bitTorrent
==========

A bitTorrent client in Python as my latest creation in HackerSchool.  

Requires the requests, bencode, hashlib, random, socket, struct, and bitstring libraries.

Currently does not have uploading capabilities, which I realizes makes me a bad, bad Internet denizen.
Rest assured that this is only due to this being a work-in-progress and not because I am a soulless leecher.  

As always, feedback and collaboration are encouraged.
